# pwn/0-binary-debugging

TODO:

This is meant to be a module for:
- getting people more familiar with how C/C++ compiles
    - linking types
    - functions and stack frames
    - registers
    - binary protection flags (don't need to cover the details)
- how to debug using gdb (maybe start with python pdb then go into debug symbols enabled then disabled)
    - starting gdb
    - basic controls
    - gbd addons
    - input from python
- and build some basic mental visualization skills of stacks/frames/memory
    - endianness
    - what the stack looks like in x86 and x64
